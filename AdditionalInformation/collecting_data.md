# Collecting your own data
Collecting your own data is also a possibility in the practical assignment. Please note that collecting your own data is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Yet, the advantage is that you can fully control the experimental design which allows you to tailor your data to your research question. Also, you will automatically gain 1.0 bonus point if you manage to gather your own data succesfully! If you choose this, there are a few things to consider:

## Experimental protocol
- In the project proposal, describe and justify the protocol for data collection in great detail
- Describe and justify the target population
- Explain and justify the quantitative research methods you intent to use

## Ethical quickscan
- Do the [ethical quickscan](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-of-information-and-computing-sciences/ethics-and-privacy) and make sure your research is allowed without further assessment. Doing a full ethical assessment would take longer than the time span of this course. 
- Append the results of your quickscan to the project proposal and describe the considerations behind your answers in great detail.

## Back-up plan
- Provide a back-up plan involving the usage of an existing dataset in case your data collection fails. 
- Clearly state the minimum number of participants you need to answer your research question. If this number is not reached, you should fall back to your back-up plan.
