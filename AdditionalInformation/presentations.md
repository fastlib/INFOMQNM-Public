## Schedule

The following schedule has been created by first scheduling preferred presentations dates and then filling the remaining slots in the well-known order. Finally, the order per day has been randomized. 

If you are scheduled in the first half, be nice to your peers and stay for the second half of the lecture to support them in their presentation. Conversely, if scheduled in the second half, come in for the first half and be nice and support your fellow students in their presentations. **Showing respect to each other's work is highly appreciated by both your fellow students and me.**
