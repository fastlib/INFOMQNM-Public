# Schedules

## Feedback session 2

Due to GDPR and privacy reasons, only team ID's are used. See blackboard for team information. Specifically, the announcement of Tuesday May 14th. There you can find an Excel file containing the teams and their ID's.

I've chosen to keep the order the same and not flip it for the second session. If it was flipped, the teams that were last the previous time were going to be scheduled early in the morning which is also not a preferred time (I guess). Hence, I decided to keep the order te same to keep it fair for everyone. Unfortunately, due to the number of teams, there are 5 teams who are scheduled outside the official timeslot. You can email me to reschedule the meeting if this does not work for you.
